# Weeknotes for 20th March 2020


**I am struggling** with this hole lockdown thing. If you know me I’m pretty social person and Im starting to struggling with the fact I haven’t seen a human in 3 weeks.

**I want** to thank my friends. Iv had a few nights on video calls with some of friends and it sorta help keep things normal ish.

**I am setting** myself a goal to finish my ep/a single of synth music by the time lockdown ends. Just one song would be good.

**I was thinking** about binning off weeknotes whilst all this craziness is happening but after talking some people Im going to try and keep doing em. I guess this really is the new normal…

**I am listening** to [The Difference by Flume and Toro y Moi](https://open.spotify.com/album/3QgFzksD4J43TnGIJOOrRV?highlight=spotify:track:4nlvKIIetOWGIMyhjQXgOZ), totally in love with this song. It sounds hopeful and reminds me of better times somehow.
