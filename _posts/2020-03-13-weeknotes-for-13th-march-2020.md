# Weeknotes for 13th March 2020


**I still** haven’t written that long form blog about 3 months at the new job with difrent. I just keep forgetting to writing it.

**I am** working from home now for however long that lasts. Things got a bit weird quick right? I was in the pub last Friday and now everything is basically closed. Stay safe.

**I don’t** really like working from home that much. One day a week is pretty good because it allows you to decompress and think about the week you just had. A full week is a much much.

**I created** this silly [corona virus lockdown playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2817yet87Ee3j1PNVXIkvO?si=2NKIA2jxRQup4ZaoIe5-4A) whilst I was bored the other night. Enjoy it, you can add songs and everything!

**I brought** a [Behringer RD-8 Rhythm Designer](https://www.gear4music.com/Keyboards-and-Pianos/Behringer-RD-8-Rhythm-Designer/2V96?origin=product-ads&campaign=PLA+Shop+-+GENERIC&adgroup=GENERIC&medium=vertical_search&network=google&merchant_id=1279443&product_id=133818d1&product_country=GB&product_partition_id=776404360722&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIvcXPv4ip6AIVCLDtCh3JxwLPEAQYASABEgImxPD_BwE). Going full Prince whilst this social distancing thing continues. Expect some weird beats by me coming out soon ish

**I also** brought a desk chair. My old dining room chair isn’t comfy enough for a full day working from it


**I am listening** to  [Don’t Stand So Close to me by The Police](https://open.spotify.com/track/5veJDT0MLsLbhYsx42GXUD?si=v2cqrXGxT32Yhz_8SV4eYA), yes yes coronavirus joke etc.
