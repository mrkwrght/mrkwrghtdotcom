# Weeknotes for 5th March 2020


**I was** going to write a blog post about working for difrent for three months this week. I didn’t have time BUT I will next week I promise.

**I had** one of the better mental health weeks I have had in a while this week. Things are starting to make sense and I feel commutable in my own shoes again.

**I finished** work on my bit of the jobs service a few sprints back so stuff is a bit slow at the moment. Blah blah blah its never finished. Moving onto something new soon. should be good.

**I got** a new tattoo last week and I’m totally in love with it! Massive thanks to [Gavin Lyons](https://www.instagram.com/gavinlyons88/?hl=en) for doing some amazing work which will last forever! Getting one next thursday too. Exciting.

**I made** a new friend this week, hi [Chris Armstrong](https://twitter.com/ChrisPArmstrong)! Went out for some sweet sherry together twice this week. Good laugh both times. Did I mention my team is dead canny

**I went** to a lot of bars this week. Maybe I should slow down? Maybe I should enjoy myself while Im still young. 30 is coming and I can almost see it. Live Fast and all that bullshit.


**I am listening** to  [True Love Waits by Radiohead](https://open.spotify.com/album/6vuykQgDLUCiZ7YggIpLM9?highlight=spotify:track:01ZpFhrMMqKPVCwyqXneVp). What can I say? Emotion rollercoaster init. Thom Yorke is amazing and you can hear the emotion in his voice singing this.
