I was very unsure about my career going into this year at HMRC Digital, I mean I knew I wanted to do something in the digital space but what?

I had spent most of my summer working for a agency doing graphic design work, I really enjoyed that and I knew I was on the right track to find the thing I would really love to do. As soon as I started working here on real projects and feeling like I’m helping people daily interaction with government

something clicked

My time at HMRC has really helped me as a designer and not only that but as a person too. This place is full of awesome people I think I have created some great working relationship and some great friends! hope to work with some of them in the future.
Really all I want to say is a big thank you to the design community at HMRC for welcoming me in with open arms and everyone there for being awesome!

Keep fighting the good fight ✊

Maybe I’ll be back one day but for now it’s time to go and finish this degree..
