   <p>Hello, my name is Mark Wright.</p>
   <p>I am an interaction and visual designer based in North East England. I work with people and clients across the UK.</p>
 <p>I create designs based on user needs and research. I build and use prototypes to test my ideas to make sure they are usable, accessible and meet the needs of the people who use them.</p>
  <p> I am in the final year of my <a href="http://www.tees.ac.uk/undergraduate_courses/Computing_&amp;_Web/" target="_blank" class="link">BA in Web and Multimedia</a> at Teesside University. I have designed government transactional services for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs" target="_blank" class="link">HM Revenue and Customs</a>.</p>
